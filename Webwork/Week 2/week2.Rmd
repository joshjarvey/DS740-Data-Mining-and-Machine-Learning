## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
library(readr)
library(FNN)
boston = read_csv("C:/Users/joshj/Documents/DS740-Data Mining and Machine Learning/Webwork/Week 1/BostonStd.csv")
boston = boston[,2:6]

  #pull 2 predictor variables, and 1 response variable
x.std = boston[,c("age.std", "rad.std", "crim")]

  #put into their own variable names
train.x = x.std[c("age.std", "rad.std")]
train.y = x.std$crim

  #use KNN regression using the x's, to predict the y's.
predictions = knn.reg(train.x,NULL,train.y,k=25)

  #calculate MSE by taking actual - predictions, square it, and average it altogether.
mean((train.y - predictions$pred)^2)


train.y

predictions$pred

```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
