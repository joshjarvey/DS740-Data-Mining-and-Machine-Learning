## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
x=2
  #no dividend
1/(1+4*exp((20*x-100)/72))

  #yes dividend
(4*exp((20*x-100)/72))/(1+(4*exp(((20*x)-100)/72)))
      
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r}

mu1 = 10
mu2 = 0
sd_all = 6

mu1/sd_all^2
log(.8) - ((mu1^2)/(2*sd_all^2))


mu2/sd_all^2
log(.2) - ((mu2^2)/(2*sd_all^2))

xvec = c(-.009,.009)

```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.



```{r}

  #read in the data
dividends = read.csv("C:/Users/joshj/Documents/DS740-Data Mining and Machine Learning/Webwork/Week 4/Dividends.csv")
  #fit a logisitic regression model to the data. predict y using the variable x
fit = glm(y~x, data = dividends, family = "binomial")

  
library(pROC)
  #create a roc curve object where the response is y from the dataset, and the predictor is x
myroc = roc(response = dividends$y, predictor = dividends$x)
  #plot the roc and calculate the area under the curve
plot.roc(myroc)
auc(myroc)

  #now fit a second model usind lda
library(MASS)
fit2 = lda(y~x, data = dividends)

  #make predictions using the same dataset used to fit the model. $class extracts the predicted classes for each observation.
fittedclass = predict(fit2,data=dividends)$class
  #table the actual y values vs. the predicted y values to create a confusion matrix.
