## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:


```{r, echo=FALSE}
library(MASS)
data("Boston")
head(Boston)
?Boston
```



```{r}
library(FNN)

set.seed(100, sample.kind = "Rounding")

train = sample(1:506, 350, replace = F)

train.x = Boston[train,c("age","rad")]
valid.x = Boston[-train,c("age","rad")]
train.y = Boston[train,c("crim")]
```

```{r}
  #scale the training dataset with the 2 variables
train.x.std = scale(train.x)
  #check the attributes of the scaled dataset. scaled:center will provide the mean
attr(train.x.std,"scaled:center")
  #scaled:scale will provide the standard deviation.
attr(train.x.std,"scaled:scale")

  #we scale the validation set now, using the same mean and std (center and scale) that we found up above. 
  # we do this to keep things consistent across data sets. 
valid.x.std = scale(valid.x, center = attr(train.x.std,"scaled:center"), scale = attr(train.x.std,"scaled:scale"))

```

```{r}
  #run the knn using 25 neighbors
predictions = knn.reg(train.x.std, valid.x.std, train.y, k=25)
  #calculate the MSE of the model
mean((Boston$crim[-train] - predictions$pred)^2)

  #now we are asked to scale the variables again
Bos.scaled = scale(Boston[,c("age","rad")])
  #change the col names so they represent the scaled to standard scale
colnames(Bos.scaled) = c("age.std","rad.std")

  #bind the scaled values with the nonscaled values, and include crime as well
Boston2 = cbind(Bos.scaled,Boston[,c("age","rad","crim")])

  #write this output to a .csv file. 
write.csv(Boston2,"C:/Users/joshj/Documents/DS740-Data Mining and Machine Learning/Webwork/Week 1/BostonStd.csv")

```
