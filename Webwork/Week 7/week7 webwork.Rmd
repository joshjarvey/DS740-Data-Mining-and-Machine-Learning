## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
  #read in the dataset
survival = read.csv("C:/Users/joshj/Documents/DS740-Data Mining and Machine Learning/Webwork/Week 7/CancerSurvival01.csv")
  #change the response variable to a factor
#survival$Survival01 = as.factor(survival$Survival01)

  #load the tree library
library(tree)
  #fit the tree model to the data
fit = tree(Survival01~.,data = survival)
  #plotting the tree and showing labels
plot(fit)
text(fit,pretty = 0)
  #checking summary to see misclassification rate (overall, full data).
summary(fit)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
fit
```

```{r}
  #set seed for reproducability
set.seed(400, sample.kind = "Rounding")

  #completing cross-validation on my fitted tree. We use the pruning function (FUN = prune.misclass) since this is a classification problem.
cvfit = cv.tree(fit, FUN = prune.misclass)

  #plot the resulting process, we notice that size 6 seems to be the best tree. 
plot(cvfit)

  #whats the minimum deviance from the CV?
min(cvfit$dev)

  #what index does 80 live at?
which(cvfit$dev == 80)

  #for index number 3 (which has the minimum deviance), what is the size of this tree? We can see this is 3 leaves.
cvfit$size[which(cvfit$dev == 80)]

  #now that we've found the best number of leaves to use (3), we will prune the tree using the prune.misclass() function
  #we pass it the tree, and best = 3 for number of leaves.
  #note: we could use prune.tree() if this was regression.
prunedFit = prune.misclass(fit, best = 3)
plot(prunedFit)
text(prunedFit,pretty = 0)
```


```{r}
library(gbm)

set.seed(400, sample.kind = "Rounding")
#survival$Survival01 = as.integer(survival$Survival01)

  #fit a boosted tree model
  #5000 trees, lambda (learning rate) = 0.001, interaction = 2 (so it can split at least twice), and distribution is "bernoulli" since it is a classification problem. Would be "gaussian" if regression problem. 
boostTree = gbm(Survival01~., data = survival, n.trees = 5000, shrinkage = 0.001, distribution = "bernoulli",interaction.depth = 2)


summary(boostTree)

plot.gbm(boostTree, i="Nodes")
```

```{r}
  #load the randomforest library to bag a random forest
library(randomForest)

set.seed(400, sample.kind = "Rounding")

  #create a bagged random forest. mtry=3, which is the number of remaining predictor variables. importance = true so we can check the most important variable[s] later.
baggedTree = randomForest(Survival01~.,data = survival, mtry=3, importance=TRUE)
  #check confusion matrix and Out of bag misclass rate (misclass for each tree on those samples not used)
baggedTree
  #plot the model to check when error rate begins to level off.
plot(baggedTree)
legend("topright", colnames(baggedTree$err.rate),col=1:3,lty=1:3)

  #check the importance of each predictor. 
    #mean() decrease accuracy shows how well it does with improving the accuracy
    #mean() decrease gini shows how well it does with reducing the gini index, which helps with node purity.
importance(baggedTree)
  #plot the importance of each predictor.
varImpPlot(baggedTree)
