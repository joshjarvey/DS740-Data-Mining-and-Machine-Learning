## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
x1 = c(3,2,4,1,2,4,4)
x2 = c(4,2,4,4,1,3,1)
y = as.factor(c("red","red","red","red","blue","blue","blue"))

data = data.frame(x1,x2,y)


library(e1071)

svmfit = svm(y~.,data = data, kernel="linear", cost = 1, type = "C-classification")

svmfit$coefs

svmfit$SV

  #not enough datapoints to CV
#tunedsvm = tune(svmfit, y~.,data = data, kernel="linear", ranges = list(cost = c(.001,.01,.1,1,5,10,100)), type = "C-classification")

```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r}
  #read in the dataset, but use semi-colon as seperator
bank = read.csv("C:/Users/joshj/Documents/DS740-Data Mining and Machine Learning/Webwork/Week 9/bank-additional.csv",sep = ";")

  #plot the SCALED emp.var.rate vs. SCALED duration. (we scale here because they are drastically different from each other)
  #set plot character to circle and squares where "yes" get character 22, and "no" gets character 21.
  #set color of the characters the same way where yes gets blue, and no gets red.
  #finally, add a legend in the top right, text, plot character, and color.
plot(scale(bank$emp.var.rate), scale(bank$duration), pch = c(21,22)[bank$y], col = c("red","blue")[bank$y])
legend("topleft", legend = c("No", "Yes"), pch = c(21, 22), col = c("red","blue"))



svmfit2 = svm(y~emp.var.rate+duration, data = bank, cost = 1, kernel = "linear", type = "C-classification")
summary(svmfit2)


table(svmfit2$fitted,bank$y)


  #those that do not invest, it suggested 16 would but is a false positive. 
16/(16+3652)

  #those that do invest, it suggested 417 would not, but is a false positive.
417/(417+34)


w = colSums(svmfit2$coefs[,1] * svmfit2$SV)
b = svmfit2$rho
# Optimal line
abline(b/w[2],-w[1]/w[2]) # y-int, slope
# Margin lines
abline((b-1)/w[2],-w[1]/w[2], lty=2) # y-int, slope; 
            # as cost decreases, w[2] tends to decrease, resulting in a larger margin
abline((b+1)/w[2],-w[1]/w[2], lty=2) 
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.





```{r}
##this cell takes a long time to run and do the cross validation to get best cost and gamma.

  #set seed to 999
set.seed(999, sample.kind = "Rounding")

library(e1071)

  #tune the svm listed using various cost and gamma parameters
tunedsvm4 = tune(svm, y~duration+emp.var.rate,data = bank, kernel="radial", ranges = list(
  cost = c(.001,.01,.1,1,5,10,100),
  gamma = c(.5,1,2,3,4)), 
type = "C-classification")


```




```{r}
  #check summary of tuned model. 
summary(tunedsvm4)

  #pull out the best model (that had the lowest CV10 error)
best.mod = tunedsvm4$best.model
  
  #create a new observation
newClient = data.frame(duration = 250, emp.var.rate = 1)

  #use the best model to predict if the new client will buy a product or not. 
predict(best.mod, newClient)

```



```{r}
xgrid = cbind(rep(seq(-4, 2, length=1000), 1000), 
             rep(seq(0, 4000, length=1000), each=1000) )

func = predict(best.mod,xgrid,decision.values = TRUE)
```

```{r}
func = attributes(func)$decision

plot()

```
