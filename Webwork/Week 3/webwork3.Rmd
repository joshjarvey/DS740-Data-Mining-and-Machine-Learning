## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
library(readr)
library(pROC)
badregression = read_csv("C:/Users/joshj/Documents/DS740-Data Mining and Machine Learning/Webwork/Week 3/BadRegression.csv")


myroc = roc(response = badregression$y, predictor = badregression$predictvals)
plot.roc(myroc)
auc(myroc)


#The boxplot shows that this model is not doing a decent job of predicting y--it’s actually doing worse than assigning probabilities randomly! This can happen when the training set used to build the regression model is not a good representation of validation set used to build the ROC curve.
boxplot(badregression$predictvals~badregression$y)

#So why did the ROC curve look decent? The answer is in the R output:
#    Data: badReg$predictvals in 500 controls (badReg$y 0) > 500 cases (badReg$y 1).
#This is saying that the predictvals for y=0 tended to be larger than the predictvals for y=1. The roc() function looks at this, and treats an observation as a (true or false) “positive” if the predictval is below each threshold value it tests.
#This flexibility means that ROC curves work for other purposes than predicted probabilities (for example, predicting that someone will get scurvy if their vitamin C intake is below a certain threshold). But for our purposes, we can force roc() to associate larger probabilities with y=1 using the direction argument:
myroc = roc(response=badregression$y, predictor=badregression$predictvals, direction = "<")
plot(myroc)
auc(myroc)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r}
library(readr)
library(pROC)
heart = read_csv("C:/Users/joshj/Documents/DS740-Data Mining and Machine Learning/Webwork/Week 3/Heart_disease_Cleveland.csv")

summary(heart)

#Sex, ChestPain, HighBloodSugar, ECG, ExerAngina, Slope, and Thal as factors.
heart$Sex = as.factor(heart$Sex)
heart$ChestPain = as.factor(heart$ChestPain)
heart$HighBloodSugar = as.factor(heart$HighBloodSugar)
heart$ECG = as.factor(heart$ECG)
heart$ExerAngina = as.factor(heart$ExerAngina)
heart$Slope = as.factor(heart$Slope)
heart$Thal = as.factor(heart$Thal)

#setting up a 2 factor variable for if they have HD or not.
heart$HD = as.factor(ifelse(heart$DiseaseStatus == "0",0,1))

fit = glm(HD~., data = heart, family = "binomial")


fit = lm(STdepress~.-HD, data = heart)
par(mfrow = c(2, 2))
plot(fit) # where fit is what you called the regression model



#very right skewed
hist(heart$STdepress)
boxplot(heart$STdepress)

  #log of 0 in STdepress would cause -inf, so we have to +1 before we do the log.
fit2 = lm(log(STdepress+1) ~ .-HD, data = heart)
plot(fit2)

AIC(fit) #775.8331
AIC(fit2) #304.5113
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
